Each meeting will be documented so people in different timezone/otherwise unable to attend will be able to catch-up.

## March 26th Meeting notes (with ITS)

### Pre-meeting
Questions:
- How do you want authentication to work? 
- Will ITS be adding Zoom links or will teachers do it?
- How do we get access to their schedule (if teachers do it)?
- How are you generating the PDFs?
- Can we reuse your ChoateSIS css verbatim? (plagiarism)
